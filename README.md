# About
This repository contains the UI part of the project proteus. The user interface uses Bootstrap,HTML,CSS and Javascript for creating responsive web pages. The user-interface consumes data using REST based services exposed in the backend project. AngularJS is the Javascript Framework used to stitch the model and view together. This project is an independant project, something which I developed out of my own interest of learning AngularJS.
